What is Chatbot?
Chatbot is an AI-based software designed to interact with people in their native languages. These conversations are often presented in a visual or textual way, and can exemplify the language of the people by communicating with people in a human-like way. Chatbot is obviously one of the best applications for natural language processing.

Chatbots can be divided into two main categories - Rule-Based and Self-learning.

The Rule-based approach trains the chatbot to answer questions based on a set of pre-set rules for which it was originally trained. These set rules can be very simple or very complex. While legitimate discussions can handle simple questions well, they often fail to process complex questions / requests.
